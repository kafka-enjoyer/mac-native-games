# Third-party code

Code in this repository that comes from other projects keeps its license; the license file sits next to the code.

Vendored source snapshots in `dependencies/sources` (with their upstream license files), or preinstalled Homebrew libraries linked at build time. See `dependencies/README.md` and `dependencies/manifest.json` for the complete offline bundle and provenance:

| Code | Use | License |
|---|---|---|
| [SPIRV-Cross](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Cross) at `aa217ae` | SPIR-V to Metal Shading Language | Apache-2.0 |
| [hactool](https://github.com/SciresM/hactool) at `1d64a83` (with explicit private title-key-file hook), including its bundled mbedTLS | Base + update BKTR merge at build time only | ISC (hactool), Apache-2.0 (mbedTLS); see `dependencies/sources/hactool` LICENSE files |
| libopus (Homebrew on Mac; vendored v1.6.1 source in `dependencies/sources/opus` for iOS), linked statically | Opus audio | BSD-3-Clause; see upstream license files for bundled components |
| libvpx (Homebrew on Mac; vendored v1.16.0 source in `dependencies/sources/libvpx` for iOS), linked statically | VP9 movies | BSD-3-Clause |

Python binary wheels and their transitive dependencies are stored in `dependencies/wheels`; each wheel includes its upstream license notices. Exact versions and hashes are in `dependencies/requirements-macos-arm64-py314.lock`.

Translator NuGet package archives are vendored in `dependencies/dotnet/packages`, with upstream license notices inside each archive. Complete versions/content hashes are in `dependencies/dotnet/locks`, archive SHA-256 hashes in `dependencies/dotnet/SHA256SUMS`, and provenance/toolchain requirements in `dependencies/dotnet/README.md`. The .NET SDK remains a pinned Homebrew prerequisite rather than a vendored SDK.
